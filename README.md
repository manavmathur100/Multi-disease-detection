# Multi-disease-detection
## Description:
I developed the "Multiple Disease Prediction System" as a web application using Streamlit, a Python library for creating interactive data applications. This project aimed to provide users with a convenient and user-friendly platform to predict the likelihood of two significant health conditions: diabetes and heart disease.

## Key Achievements and Contributions:

Machine Learning Models: Implemented and integrated pre-trained machine learning models for disease prediction. These models included a diabetes prediction model and a heart disease prediction model, which were trained on relevant medical data.

User Interface Design: Designed an intuitive user interface that allowed users to input their health-related parameters, such as glucose levels, blood pressure, age, and more. The user-friendly interface included a sidebar for easy navigation and icons for visual appeal.

Interactive Features: Developed interactive features, including buttons for initiating disease prediction, and displayed the results in a clear and informative manner.

### Data Handling:
Implemented data input forms to securely collect user data for prediction, ensuring privacy and data security.

### Error Handling:
Implemented error handling to provide users with clear feedback in case of invalid inputs or technical issues.

### Model Integration:
Successfully integrated machine learning models into the application, allowing real-time prediction based on user inputs.

### Project Documentation:
Maintained documentation for the project, including descriptions of the models used, data sources, and dependencies.

### File Management:
Managed file paths for loading saved machine learning models, ensuring seamless model loading within the Streamlit environment.

This project not only showcased my skills in web application development and machine learning but also demonstrated my ability to create practical solutions with real-world applications. It highlights my proficiency in Python, Streamlit, and data handling, as well as my commitment to providing accessible and valuable tools for healthcare prediction.
